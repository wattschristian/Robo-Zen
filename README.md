# Robo-Zen
This is our Capstone project implementation at the University of Missouri - Columbia. It is a 3D printed robotic arm with a circular base, meant to copy a digital drawing and recreate it on a bed of sand. It uses a Swift mobile application to communicate with a Raspberry Pi controller through the use of a RESTful service. Production code was written in Swift and Python.

## NOTE: 
There are several files that were part of the design and debug phases, the primary execution folders/files are as follows: RoboZeniOSApp, RestAPI.py, motorCoordination.py
